# M4 Handoff

## Task 4.1 Complete: Update README with Complete Documentation

**Expanded README from 93 to 165 lines** (under 200-line target). Added:
- Workflow pipeline diagram showing command chaining
- Per-command documentation (what it does, what it produces, usage)
- Configuration guide with per-section table (which skills use what, required vs optional)
- Troubleshooting table (5 common issues)
- Removed Lux from "Relationship" table (private, shouldn't be in public README)

**Next Task Notes (4.2 — AGENTS.md):**
- Check actual file tree against what AGENTS.md describes
- Add `skills/shared/` and `implementation/` docs to structure
- Add development workflow section
